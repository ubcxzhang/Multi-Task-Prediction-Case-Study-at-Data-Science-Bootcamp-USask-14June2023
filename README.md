# Multi-Task-Prediction-Case-Study-at-Data-Science-Bootcamp-USask
Welcome to Bootcamp T7! In this session, we will introduce the basic concepts of multi-task prediction and our novel method development in this research direction. MTPS is a new R package we developed for conducting the revisited stacking algorithm to predict multiple outcomes simultaneously. We will have a hands-on session in the afternoon. So please bring your laptop for the hands-on session.  

## Date and Location
- Date: June 14th, 2023
- Location: HLTH B450 (Health Science Building, B Wing)

## Instructor
Dr. Xuekui Zhang (PhD) is an Assistant Professor at University of Victoria, a Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (2017-2027), and a Michael Smith Health Research BC Scholar (2022-2027). Dr. Zhangâ€™s research focuses on developing and applying novel biostatistics methods and software tools to solve real-world problems in medical research. His research interests include bioinformatics, biostatistics, machine learning, design of clinical trials, and COPD. More information can be found on his website https://ubcxzhang.github.io/.

## Schedule
### Session 1: 9:30am - 11:30am
- 9:30am-11:00am: Lecture on ensemble machine learning approaches and MTPS by Dr.Zhang
- 11:00am-11:30am: Tutorial about R code behind MTPS with continuous, binary and mixed outcomes by Kyle (TA)
### Session 2: 1:00pm - 2:30pm
- Practice on R yourself and complete simple exercises with the help of Kyle (TA) and Xiaowen (Tutor)

**Please note that you will need to bring your own laptop. However, rest assured that all the necessary materials, including the required software such as R and the contributed package MTPS, will be provided through GitHub.**

Please join us for an engaging and enlightening learning experience, where we will embark on this exciting journey together! We can't wait to see you there!
